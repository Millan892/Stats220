# A Little bit about me - Millan Kelderman
My full name is **Millan Arie Sharma Kelderman** 
I am 18 years old, although I get mistaked for *older*, more frequently then I care to say. 
## Career Interests
I have taken Computer Science since the first year of Highschool and has basically been the main point of interest for me, Career wise ever since. 
There is an forever increasing number of paths that Compsci can take you down that a short numbered listed would only be able to name a few of the possibilites
### Such as 
1. Artificial Intelligence 
- And even that has more lanes and avenues 
2. Cyber Security 
- And like my cousin, could be a Lawyer by day, and work cybersecurity fighting off russians by night
3. Data Scientist
- Otherwise wouldn't be taking Statistics would I 
#### Artificial Intelligence
One short Youtube series actaully that piqued my interest was [Age of AI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjq6DwYksrzz_fsWIpPcf6V7p2RNAneKc) featuring Robert Downey Jr and Will.I.Am discussing a whole range of topics, concerning Artificial Intelligence
